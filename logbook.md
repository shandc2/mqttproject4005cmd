Week 1:
- Figured out project scope
- Setup dev environment on pc
- Installed mosquitto
- Created github repo
- Started report

Week 2:
- Got mosquitto up and running
- Created first working version of simulated motion sensor
- Verified that it is publishing to mosquitto (locally)
- Created first working version of temperature sensor
- Experimented with MQTT

- Created first working version of fan_controller.py

Week 3:
- Completed fan_controller, heater_controller, temp_sensor and motion_sensor
- confirmed all data is being published and received
- created subscriber.py

Week 4:
- created subscriber_gui_simple.py
- tweaked motion_sensor publishing logic
- tried to tweak fan_controller & heater_controller logic but had to revert to previous versions as they seemed to stop working
- finalised report, diagram, psuedocode

IDEAS:
- GUI to change 'desired temperature'
- GUI monitoring system (shows temp, motion status, fan status etc.)
